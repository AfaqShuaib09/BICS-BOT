Before you start using this server there is something you should know.

This server is currently using a system where you need to **enroll** or **unenroll** to view the courses text channels.
The idea is very simple. Once you know the courses you will take, or are currently taking, you can make use of the command `/enrol` to enroll to the desired courses text channels.
In case you want to do the oposite, for instance because of a mistake, you can use the command `/unenroll`.

**Note:** You can at any time use both commands.
